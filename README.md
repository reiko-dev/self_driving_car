A Flutter Version of the Self-Driving Car made originally in Vanilla Javascript by [Dr. Radu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XGlNq8O5hZlZBJlSFB4jg).

This Project uses Neural Networks and the Genetic algorithm of Machine Learning, to control cars in a Road with other cars.

The data generated by the Neural Networks are shown using a Widget.
